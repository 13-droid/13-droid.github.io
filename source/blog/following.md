# Who I am following and what for

This is my notes about people I follow on the web. This is an alternate index for people I follow 
so that I won't have to rely on Twitter to remember they exist, nor have to give them a prerequisite 
of having an rss feed to stay in my reading rotation.

Legend:
I'm tagging links in this article with pound/number sign tips. 
- #rss : self-explanatory, really.
- #blog: a person's blog
- #blogs: a person's index of blogs they read/follow
- #newsletter: a newsletter they may be curating
