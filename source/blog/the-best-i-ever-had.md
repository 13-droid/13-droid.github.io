# The best _ I ever had

A register of places where I had the best ever x, whatever x may be.

## The best icecream I ever had

We randomly stumbled upon this icecream shop when we were visiting Margate. Really creamy and delicious, 
so much so that it inspired me to create a best x I ever had log to never forget a place where I had so
good of an experience.

Apparently Karl Marx stayed in the exact spot the shop is in, which is kinda cool.

The place is just on one of the main streets of Margate, right across market square.

## The best view I ever had

The best view I have ever seen in my life must be the view from my mountaineering days at uni.

1. Left my tent in the middle of the night after a storm, and the sky was so clear and the moonlight was reflected on the snow, that I could put on my number 1.

2. The view from the Mt. Erciyes summit, could go on my number 2.

Unfortunately, I have photos of neither, and even if I did, I'm sure they wouldn't look half as impressive. Here are a few pics to give you an idea of the general vibe.
