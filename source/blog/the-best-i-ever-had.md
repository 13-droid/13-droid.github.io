## The best icecream I ever had

We randomly stumbled upon this icecream shop when we were visiting Margate. Really creamy and delicious, 
so much so that it inspired me to create a best x I ever had log to never forget a place where I had so
good of an experience.

Apparently Karl Marx stayed in the exact spot the shop is in, which is kinda cool.

The place is just on one of the main streets of Margate, right across market square.
