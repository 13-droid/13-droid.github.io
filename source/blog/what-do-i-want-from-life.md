# What do I want from life?

This is no simple question, and _everyone_ has their own answers. Some people are quite opinionated about it, some people
have never even given it a second thought. 

I am trying to be more mindful about the way I live my life. Thats the big theme of 2025 for me. I try to be more aware of
my surroundings, physically, socially, and life-ly (lifewise? idk). And as such, I have decided to not shoo away the BIG
QUESTIONS when they come to mind.

~~ we need tenets ~~

In Stephen King's [Needful Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needful_Things), a mysterious shopkeeper grants people their
deepest desires, but each wish comes at a horrific cost. This is obviously not a concept invented by King.
You're probably familiar with this concept from old web forums' fun-game version "name a wish but the next person gets to give
it a side effect". This is my choice of examplifying that what we think we want, the small things, may not actually be what
we want at the end of the day. We need to evaluate an exact minimum-viable tangible set of things we want, that can't be
corrupted, and can help us live a fulfilling life.

~~ the rules, unchanging concepts of the desire for fulfillment ~~
