# Useful online tools 

This is my index of useful online tools. I have a few tenets: No login, does the job well, 
doesn't beg you for spare coin.

## Image operations

PNG operations, allows chaining ops. <https://onlinepngtools.com/crop-png>

## Table conversion

Any table conversion in any direction between html, csv, excel, markdown and more. 
<https://tableconvert.com/> This tool is also inspiring because it (is not but) could be a 
client-side product. God knows I like client-side tools!

## Where can you get to in _ time?

Mapnificient is a tool that shows, given a location, all the area you can get to under a 
given time constraint **with public transport**. Great tool for finding possible short 
commute neighbourhoods for your job, or finding places to visit in the weekend.
