# What do I expect from this blog

I do have another blog, where I write about more serious computer-science stuff. 
But this one is not it. However, as the now-owner of two blogs on the world wide web,
I just don't write that much.

This has been a topic that I've thought about to no particular avail; substance over form.
In the first couple years I had my blog, I don't think I've written anything on it, apart from
what I plugged into it from my previous scribblings. But I changed the way it looked for a
million times.

However, there is more than just substance (content) and form (styling). There is also
functionality, utility. I've started thinking about how I can make this blog into a utility
that will want to make me use it.

Don't get me wrong, there is no deep design thinking like the auto-regressive gradient-descent 
monster that we came to call _the algorithm_ making you dependent over it by giga-frying your
serotonin receptors; but instead something that I will take joy in using, and something that
brings everything together on my online life and fills the gaps between what I use to make the
web a social place, as well as a knowledge base.

## Remembering

I'll be honest, my memory isn't the best. And I did not have a good attention span even before
doomscrolling became a thing. It had always been a problem for me and walking into a room and
forgetting why I am there has been the norm for me for a long time.

I recently came to the realization that I just can not stick anything into my brain anymore
without constant repetition or extreme interest. Even things I am interested in have a hard
time standing against the memory storms that reap my mind at night.

So I expect this blog to become a place where I can create indices. Indices of things I like. 
Indices of experiences I had, interesting concepts I've come across, reading material, people to
follow etc. 

Why make these into a blog rather than a notion page? Because I love (1) the possibility of 
others being able to benefit from my experiences, (2) I want to create my own sphere of social
web, rather than handing over my social interactions to an evil corporation that seeks nothing
but revenue and (3) I can be free to change the medium to bend it into what I wish to do with it.

## Creating

I'm a huge nerd. I like nerding out writing new functionality for my websites. And I hope this blog
to be a place where I can experiment with wrapping the content around some extra logic to get a serotonin
hit from creating something new. 

I want to write more. Not just informative blog posts or rants; but stories, poems. Maybe get into
world-building while I'm at it. I've conlanged before, never documented any of it. I can go back and 
document other stuff I've created.

Although I don't have the time to do all this as I did in the past, I can hope to document and 
[remember](#remembering) them and have a way to look back into what I've done with my tiem when 
I had no fear of losing my abode if I wasn't doing something productive with it.

## Documenting

I have a lot of side projects that take me from anywhere between 30 minutes to a few days. And I don't 
really do anything with them. Frankly, not all of them are interesting. But I would say they are worth 
documenting. Even if they weren't successful. I've learnt early on in life that documenting how to
be unsuccessful at a task is just as important as documenting how to be successful at it.

## Connecting

And lastly, I wish to connect with people that I share interests with. Following their blogs, where
the stream of their mind runs more clearly than tweets. And see what they have to say in their own
little corner of the web, while letting anyone who's interested a window into mine.
