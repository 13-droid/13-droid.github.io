# Quoting Manuel Moreale

Manuel's new years resolution closely resembles what I've been murmuring to myself for a couple years and I have the same wishes.

> (...)
>I want 2025 to be a year where my focus is on the output, rather than on the input. Rather than being concerned with whatâ€™s happening out there, I want to focus on what I can control and that is my output, my contribution to my life and the life of others.
>
>I also want to focus more on the analogue. As much as I love the digital world, I think I need to spend more time disconnected in order to restore some semblance of mental sanity. So books, in paper form, are gonna play a huge role in this 2025.
>
>A year with fewer inputs, and more output. This is my hope for 2025. Happy New Year!
