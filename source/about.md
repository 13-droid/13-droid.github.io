# About

I created this blog to be able to write freely without chipping away at the presentability of my professional personal blog.

## Why the name

[Misty step](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Misty%5FStep) is a conjuration spell for short-term 
teleportation in D&D 5e, bg3 etc. Found it quite handy in BG3. I thought I would quickly 
pivot from topic to topic in this blog too, hence I found the name suiting.
