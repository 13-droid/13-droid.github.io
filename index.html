<p>On the beginning of 2025, in line with my new year's aspirations, I left Twitter. I chose Mastodon to be my new microblogging home on the web. I was asked why I didn't go for Bluesky. I wanted to give a comprehensive response to this, and here it is.</p>
<b>1. The Algorithm</b>
<p>Ever since my first exposure to "the algorithm" (which was many years ago when facebook switched from the chronologic feed to an algorithmic one) [1],
I did not like the experience. I remember, neither did many people and there was a push against it. Facebook later made that the hard-default [2]. IIRC
they later removed the chronological timeline as it hurt their business as people were spending less time on facebook that way. This hurt their business
because it relies on maximizing the time you spend there. The latter was quite addictive and it beat the purpose for which I was on social media; to 
connect with people. Instead it became a tool of media consumption. </p>

<p>I was reading How bad is link rot on my blog?
on Terence Eden's blog. It’s an article where he shares his experience tending to outgoing links in his blog. He shares
some interesting data on it as well. I encourage you to have a read.</p>
<p>This is an interesting topic. Let me quote some relevant bits for me to set the scene if you're not bothering to read his full post.  </p></div><span class="a">(Read more)</span></a></div>

<a class="previewHref" href="blog/./this-blog"><div><div class="preview-title"><h2>What I expect from this blog</h2></div>
<p>I do have another blog, where I write about more serious computer-science stuff. 
But this one is not that. However, as the now-owner of two blogs on the world wide web,
I have a problem. I just don't write that much.</p>
<p>In the first couple years I had my blog, I don't think I've written anything on it, apart from
what I plugged into it from my previous scribblings. But I changed the way it looked for a
million times. This has been a topic that I've thought about to no particular avail; substance 
over form.</p>
<p>However, there is more than just substance (content) and form (styling). There is also
functionality, utility. I've started thinking about how I can make this blog into a utility
that will want to make me use it. Not a man-made-horror addiction-algorithm-generator, but 
instead something that I will take joy in using, and something that brings everything together 
on my online life and fills the gaps between what I use to make the web a social place, 
as well as a knowledge base.</p>

<p>Manuel's new years resolution closely resembles what I've been murmuring to myself for a couple years and I have the same wishes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(...)
I want 2025 to be a year where my focus is on the output, rather than on the input. Rather than being concerned with what’s happening out there, I want to focus on what I can control and that is my output, my contribution to my life and the life of others.</p>
<p>I also want to focus more on the analogue. As much as I love the digital world, I think I need to spend more time disconnected in order to restore some semblance of mental sanity. So books, in paper form, are gonna play a huge role in this 2025.</p>
<p>A year with fewer inputs, and more output. This is my hope for 2025. Happy New Year!</p>
