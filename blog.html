<p>This is my index of useful online tools. I have a few tenets: No login, does the job well, doesn't beg you for spare coin.</p>
<p>PNG operations, allows chaining ops. https://onlinepngtools.com/crop-png</p>
<p>Any table conversion in any direction between html, csv, excel, markdown and more. 
https://tableconvert.com/ This tool is also inspiring because it (is not but) could be a client-side product. God knows I like client-side tools!</p></div></a></div>

<a class="previewHref" href="blog/./the-best-i-ever-had"><div><div class="preview-title"><h2>The best _ I ever had</h2></div>
<p>A register of places where I had the best ever x, whatever x may be.</p>
<b>The best icecream I ever had</b>
<p>We randomly stumbled upon this icecream shop when we were visiting Margate. Really creamy and delicious, 
so much so that it inspired me to create a best x I ever had log to never forget a place where I had so
good of an experience.</p></div><span class="a">(Read more)</span></a></div>

<p><strong>I. hate. password. managers.</strong> And you should too. Please allow me to teach you to never need them again, not before a quick rant.</p>
<b>Pwned!</b>
<p>Why would I entrust all my passwords to a single service that is continuously proved to be penetrable [1] [2] [3] ?</p>
<p>Why would I risk getting pwned in all of my accounts everywhere when I can just keep them in my brain where they can't be hacked? Am I just <em>so</em> incapable of coming up with good passwords myself?</p></div><span class="a">(Read more)</span></a></div>

<a class="previewHref" href="blog/./following"><div><div class="preview-title"><h2>Who I am following and what for</h2></div>
<p>This is my notes about people I follow on the web. This is an alternate index for people I follow 
so that I won't have to rely on Twitter to remember they exist, nor have to give them a prerequisite 
of having an rss feed to stay in my reading rotation.</p>
<p>Legend:
I'm tagging links in this article with pound/number sign tips. 
- #rss : self-explanatory, really.
- #blog: a person's blog
- #blogs: a person's index of blogs they read/follow
- #newsletter: a newsletter they may be curating</p>
